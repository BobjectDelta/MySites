                        <p>Hydroelectricity, or hydroelectric power, is electricity generated from hydropower (water
                            power). Hydropower supplies
                            one sixth of the world's electricity, almost 4500 TWh in 2020, which is more than all other
                            renewable sources combined
                            and also more than nuclear power.[3]
                        </p>
                        <p>Hydropower can provide large amounts of low-carbon electricity on demand, making it a key
                            element for creating secure
                            and clean electricity supply systems.[3] A hydroelectric power station that has a dam and
                            reservoir is a flexible
                            source, since the amount of electricity produced can be increased or decreased in seconds or
                            minutes in response to
                            varying electricity demand. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, it produces no
                            direct waste, and almost always
                            emits considerably less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel powered energy plants.[4] However,
                            when constructed in lowland
                            rainforest areas, where part of the forest is inundated, substantial amounts of greenhouse
                            gases may be emitted.
