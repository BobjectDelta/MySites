                        <p>Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary
                            energy. For utilities in the
                            electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution,
                            etc.) to end users or its
                            storage (using, for example, the pumped-storage method).
                        </p>
                        <p>Electricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be "produced" (that is,
                            transforming other forms of energy to
                            electricity). Production is carried out in power stations (also called "power plants").
                            Electricity is most often
                            generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines
                            fueled by combustion or
                            nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and
                            wind. Other energy sources
                            include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.
                        </p>
                        <p>Phasing out coal-fired power stations and eventually gas-fired power stations,[1] or
                            capturing their greenhouse gas
                            emissions, is an important part of the energy transformation required to limit climate
                            change. Vastly more solar
                            power[2] and wind power[3] is forecast to be required, with electricity demand increasing
                            strongly[4] with further
                            electrification of transport, homes and industry.[5]
