                        <p>A nuclear power plant (sometimes abbreviated as NPP)[1] is a thermal power station in which
                            the heat source is a nuclear
                            reactor. As is typical of thermal power stations, heat is used to generate steam that drives
                            a steam turbine connected
                            to a generator that produces electricity. As of 2022, the International Atomic Energy Agency
                            reported there were 439
                            nuclear power reactors in operation in 32 countries around the world.[2][3]
                        </p>
                        <p>Nuclear plants are very often used for base load since their operations, maintenance, and
                            fuel costs are at the lower
                            end of the spectrum of costs. [4] However, building a nuclear power plant often spans five
                            to ten years, which can
                            accrue to significant financial costs, depending on how the initial investments are
                            financed.[5]
                        </p>
                        <p>Nuclear power plants have a carbon footprint comparable to that of renewable energy such as
                            solar farms and wind
                            farms,[6][7] and much lower than fossil fuels such as natural gas and brown coal. Despite
                            some spectacular catastrophes,
                            nuclear power plants are among the safest mode of electricity generation,[8] comparable to
                            solar and wind power
                            plants.[9]
