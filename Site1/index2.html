                        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Solar power</h2>
                        <p>Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly
                            using
                            photovoltaics (PV),
                            indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Photovoltaic cells convert
                            light into an electric current
                            using the photovoltaic effect.[2] Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and
                            solar tracking systems to
                            focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine.
                        </p>
                        <p>Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and
                            medium-sized applications, from the
                            calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop
                            PV
                            system. Commercial
                            concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. Since then, as the
                            cost
                            of solar electricity has
                            fallen, grid-connected solar PV systems have grown more or less exponentially. Millions
                            of
                            installations and
                            gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations have been and are being built. Solar PV has
                            rapidly become a viable
                            low-carbon technology, and since 2020, provides the cheapest source of electricity in
                            history.[3]
                        </p>
                        <p>As of 2021, solar generates 4% of the world's electricity, compared to 1% in 2015 when
                            the
                            Paris Agreement to limit
                            climate change was signed.[4] Along with onshore wind, the cheapest levelised cost of
                            electricity is utility-scale
                            solar.[5] The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that under its "Net Zero by 2050"
                            scenario solar power would
                            contribute about 20% of worldwide energy consumption, and solar would be the world's
                            largest
                            source of electricity.[6]
